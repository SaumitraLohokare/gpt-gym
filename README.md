# gpt-gym
An easy but opinionated way to train GPT models.

## Roadmap
- [ ] A way to load a model
- [ ] Hyperparameter settings with defaults from good papers
- [ ] A way to use datasets directly from huggingface
- [ ] A way to monitor training

### Loading a model
- Should be able to load a model from anywhere...
    - This might be difficult, for now let's leave it as pasting your model code in this repository and then using it to create a script
